I build a social media app using React Native (CLI) and firestore. The app allows users to create, display, edit/update and delete posts. For user authentication I used firebase's Email/Password auth feature.
Now I'm trying to provide my app's users the feature of edit/update user profile info. i.e. username (displayName), email, avatar (photoURL) etc. To select an image from the device I used "react-native-image-picker" library. On updating the profile info. after selecting an image and changing the username (displayName) etc. the new updated profile info. successfully appear on the UI but after app reload the newly updated info. again replaced with the previous one, why?

Note: I don't have any backend code yet to handle the profile update.




While registering (creating) new user in my app, I use to store the following info. about the user:
1. Username (displayName)
2. Email
3. Password


While creating post I use to store the following info. about the post and post's creator:
1. userId
2. Post Title
3. Post Image
4. CreatedAt

Then in order to display the posts along with their creator info. (in the form of a post card) I have the following setup:

But on creating a post, the username (displayName) doesn't show in the post card, rather "Anonymous" is showing.


On creating a post, the post successfully store into firestore but not displaying on the UI rather the following error is occurring:
"Possible unhandled promise rejection (id: 0)
